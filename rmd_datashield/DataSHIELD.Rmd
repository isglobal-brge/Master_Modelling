## DataSHIELD R Interface (DSI)

The DataSHIELD Interface (DSI) defines a set of [S4 classes and generic methods](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S4.html) that can be implemented for accessing a data repository supporting the DataSHIELD infrastructure: controlled R commands to be executed on the server side that ensure only non disclosive information is returned to client side.

### Class Structures

The DSI S4 classes are:

Class           Description
--------------- ----------------------------------
`DSObject`      A common base class for all DSI,
`DSDriver`      A class to drive the creation of a connection object,
`DSConnection`  Allows the interaction with the remote server; DataSHIELD operations such as aggregation and assignment return a result object; DataSHIELD setup status check can be performed (dataset access, configuration comparision),
`DSResult`      Wraps access to the result, which can be fetched either synchronously or asynchronously depending on the capabilities of the data repository server.

All classes are *virtual*: they cannot be instantiated directly and instead must be subclassed. See [DSOpal](https://github.com/datashield/DSOpal) for a reference implementation of DSI based on the [Opal](http://opaldoc.obiba.org/) data repository.

These S4 classes and generic methods are meant **to be used for implementing connections to a DataSHIELD-aware data repository.**

### Higher Level Functions

In addition to these S4 classes, DSI provides functions to handle a list of remote data repository servers:

Functions                                                                                 Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------
`datashield.login`                                                                        Create `DSConnection` objects for the data repositories, using the `DSDriver` specification.
`datashield.logout`                                                                       Destroy the `DSConnection`s objects.
`datashield.aggregate`, `datashield.assign`                                               Typical DataSHIELD operations on `DSConnection` objects; results can be fetched through `DSResult` objects.
`datashield.connections`, `datashield.connections_default`, `datashield.connections_find` Management of the list of `DSConnection` objects that can be discovered and used by the client-side analytic functions.
`datashield.workspaces`, `datashield.workspace_save`, `datashield.workspace_rm`           Manage R images of the remote DataSHIELD sessions (to speed up restoration of data analysis sessions).
`datashield.symbols`, `datashield.symbol_rm`                                              Minimalistic management of the R symbols living in the remote DataSHIELD sessions.
`datashield.tables`, `datashield.table_status`                                            List the tables and their accessibility across a set of data repositories.
`datashield.resources`, `datashield.resource_status`                                      List the resources and their accessibility across a set of data repositories.
`datashield.pkg_status`, `datashield.method_status`, `datashield.methods`                 Utility functions to explore the DataSHIELD setup across a set of data repositories.

These `datashield.*` functions are meant **to be used by DataSHIELD packages developers and users.**
  
### Options

Some options can be set to modify the behavior of the DSI:

Option                       Description
---------------------------- --------------------------------------
`datashield.env`             The R environment in which the `DSConnection` object list is to be looked for. Default value is the Global Environment: `globalenv()`.
`datashield.progress`        A logical to enable visibility of progress bars. Default value is `TRUE`.
`datashield.progress.clear`  A logical to make the progress bar disappear after it has been completed. Default value is `FALSE`. 
`datashield.error.stop`       A logical to alter error handling behavior: if `TRUE` an error is raised when at least one server has failed, otherwise a warning message is issued. Default value is `TRUE`.


## DataSHIELD/Opal Implementation

[Opal](#opal) is a web application that is accessible through web services. It implements DataSHIELD methods thanks to the following built-in features:

* integration with an R server, where the DataSHIELD operations will take place,
* secure data management, with fine-grained permissions (to restrict access to individual level data),
* web services API, that allows Opal operations to be run from an R script.

In addition to these features, Opal manages the DataSHIELD configuration which consists of declaring the set of permitted aggregation/assignment R functions and some R options.

### Client

The [opalr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=opalr) R package is a general purpose Opal connection R library (authentication is required) that is used to perform various operations (authorization may be required). The [DSOpal](https://cran.r-project.org/package=DSOpal) R package is an implementation of the *DSI*, built on top of *opalr*. All the DataSHIELD operations are transparently applied to one or more Opal server using the [DSI higher-level functions](#higher-level-functions). Opal also supports asynchronous function calls (submission of a R operation, then later retrieval of the result) which allows operations on several DataSHIELD analysis nodes in parallel.

### Server

On the R server managed by Opal, some DataSHIELD-compliant R packages can be managed using the Opal's web interface: installation, removal of DataSHIELD-compliant R packages and automatic DataSHIELD configuration discovery. Opal guarantees that only the allowed functions can be called. The DataSHIELD-compliant R package guarantees that only aggregated results are returned to the client. The term 'aggregated' here means that the data in the R server will go through a function that summarizes individual-level data into a non-disclosive form. For example, obtaining the length of a vector, or obtaining the summary statistics of a vector (min, max, mean, etc.).

These DataSHIELD functions are customisable. That is, administrators of the Opal server can add, remove, modify or create completely custom aggregating methods that are proposed to DataSHIELD clients.

```{r opalDSAdmin, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="DataSHIELD configuration in Opal", out.width = '90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/opal_datashield_admin.png")
```

When performing a DataSHIELD analysis session, a typical workflow on a single Opal analysis node is the following:

* authentication of the user (requires authorization to use DataSHIELD service),
* creation and initialization of an R server session,
* assignment of Opal-managed data into the R server session (requires data access authorization),
* processing incoming R operation requests (aggregation and assignment function calls requires authorization) that are forwarded to the R server session; non-disclosive aggregated result is then returned to the R client.
